#  Microcontroller Lamp-Post Project

Team project for the BEng Electrical & Electronic Engineering course at the **University of Bristol**.  
The system uses a **Raspberry Pi Pico**, **IR sensors**, and a **7-segment LED display** to detect and count vehicles on a model track.


# Overview
- IR sensors detect passing cars and send signals through a BJT circuit.  
- The Raspberry Pi Pico processes inputs and updates the LED display in real time.  
- Programmed in **MicroPython** and tested on a prototype circuit.



# My Role
- Completed **Task 2**, which involved coding the detection and counting logic in MicroPython.  
- Contributed to sections of the final report related to software implementation and testing.
